## 🚀 Project Overview

This project implements an **Image Classifier** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built with TensorFlow/Keras.  
The project hosts two models: a custom CNN model

- **Objective:** Classify images into predefined categories.
- **Framework:** TensorFlow / Keras
- **Model Type:** Deep Convolutional Neural Network (Custom)
- **Dataset:** CIFAR-10
- **Key Features:**
  - Multi-layer CNN with increasing filter complexity
  - Batch Normalization for stable learning
  - Dropout and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting
  - Global Average Pooling for lightweight classification

## ⚙️ Requirements

Install the necessary dependencies using:
pip install -r requirements.txt

---

## 🧩 Model Architecture

  The Custom CNN model: 
      - consists of multiple convolutional blocks followed by a dense classifier (see: cnn_model/image_classifier_cnn.ipynb)

## 📊 Model Results

  ### Approch 1
  
  The model results from the IPYNB notebooks include: Accuracy, Loss, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report and performance visualisations
  
  ### Approach 2
  
  For a given image, the Web application returns the image class with a probability
